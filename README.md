# This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### First, run the development server:

              ```bash
              npm run dev
              # or
              yarn dev
              ```
## Start working with it by 
      yarn create next-app your-app-name -e https://github.com/foadtkf/NextJS-starter
### or
      npx create-next-app your-app-name -e https://github.com/foadtkf/NextJS-starter
### Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### I've added [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
